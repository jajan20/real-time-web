## Week 1

#### Socket.io
Figuring out socket.io and following the chat tutorial. Refactored the jQuery examples to vanilla JS so that I didn't need to use the library.

Reality check, ```('chat message')``` and ```('chat message:')``` are completely different. I need to pay more attention to these subtle typo's.
